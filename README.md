# Rest

Representational State Transfer (REST) is an architectural style that defines a set of rules to be used for creating web services. An API is an interface through which one program or web site talks to another. They are used to share data and services. REST API is a way of accessing web services in a simple and flexible way without having any processing. Itâ€™s used to fetch or give some information from a web service. All communication done via REST API uses only HTTP request.

# Working

A request is sent from client to server in the form of web URL as HTTP GET or POST or PUT or DELETE request. After that, a response comes back from server in the form of a resource which can be anything like HTML, XML, Image or JSON. But now JSON is the most popular format being used in Web Services. 

In HTTP there are five methods which are commonly used in a REST based Architecture i.e., POST, GET, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE. These correspond to create, read, update, and delete (or CRUD) operations respectively. There are other methods which are less frequently used like OPTIONS and HEAD.
